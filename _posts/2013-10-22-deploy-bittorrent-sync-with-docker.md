My tutorial on using [Docker](http://docker.io/) to deploy [BitTorrent Sync](http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html) was just featured on the [BitTorrent Blog](http://blog.bittorrent.com/2013/10/22/sync-hacks-deploy-bittorrent-sync-with-docker/).

The project can be found on Github at [github.com/billt2006/docker-btsync/](https://github.com/billt2006/docker-btsync/).
